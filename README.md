# vim-clean
[Clean][] plugin for Vim

This plugin was originally written by [norm2782][norm2782-vim-clean]. The
syntax was adapted by [timjs][timjs-syntax]. This is a fork of that syntax by
[Camil Staps][camilstaps], with several highlighting improvements and
additional features. Minor contributions have been made by
[Mart Lubbers][dopefishh].

### Features

* Syntax highlighting for Clean and ABC code
* Switching between definition and implementation module
* Compiler errorformats
* [Cloogle][] integration (note that this requires [curl][])
* Access to the plugin manual via `:h clean`. Make sure to run `:helptags` at
  least once to update the helpfiles.

# vim-clean
[Clean][clean] plugin for Vim

This plugin was originally written by [norm2782][norm2782-vim-clean]. The
syntax was adapted by [timjs][timjs-syntax]. This is a fork of that syntax by
[Camil Staps][camilstaps], with several highlighting improvements and
additional features.

### Features

* Syntax highlighting for Clean and ABC code
* Switching between definition and implementation module
* Compiler errorformats
* [Cloogle][cloogle] integration

### Available commands

* `<LocalLeader>m`: switch between definition and implementation module
* `:Cloogle search-str`: search for `search-str` on [Cloogle][cloogle]
* `:CloogleWindow`: opens the previous Cloogle search window
